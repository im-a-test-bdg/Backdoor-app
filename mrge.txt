“When I ask you to analyze my entire codebase, which includes Swift and other file formats, I expect you to thoroughly examine all provided code and related files. Your task is to identify every error, potential problem, and anything that could be considered suboptimal or incorrect within the code. This includes, but is not limited to: syntax errors, logical flaws, runtime issues, performance bottlenecks, security vulnerabilities, code style inconsistencies, deprecated methods or practices, missing documentation, and compatibility problems across platforms or versions. Provide a comprehensive report detailing each issue, its location (file and line number, if applicable), an explanation of why it’s a problem, and, where possible, suggestions for improvement or correction. If any part of the codebase or file format is unclear or unsupported, let me know what additional information or tools might be needed to complete the analysis. Assume I want a deep, exhaustive review unless I specify otherwise.”
